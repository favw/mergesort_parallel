# mergesort_parallel
Parallel programming implementation of the merge sort algorithm

# How to run:
main() function can be found in src/ParallelMergeSort.java 
The amount of threads as well as the array size/array content can be updated through this. Alternatively you can obviously also create the arrays in another class and call the mergesort function from there.
